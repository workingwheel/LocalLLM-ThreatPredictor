1. Make sure you have Ollama installed and running on your local machine.
2. Install required Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `requests`.
3. Prepare a CSV file named 'firewall_logs.csv' with your firewall log data. It should include columns for timestamp, source_ip, source_port, dest_port, protocol, and is_attack (1 for attack, 0 for normal traffic).
4. Place the 'firewall_logs.csv' file in the same directory as your Python script.
5. Run the Python script. It will load the data, preprocess it, use the local LLM (via Ollama) to make predictions, and then evaluate the results.

A few additional notes:

- This approach uses the LLM for each individual prediction, which can be slow for large datasets. For a real-world application, you might want to batch the predictions or use a different approach for larger scale data.
- The accuracy of this method heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the LLM you're using. Make sure you're using a model that has some understanding of network security concepts.
- This example uses a simple prompt. You might want to experiment with different prompt structures to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
- Remember that this is a proof of concept. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to implement additional error handling, logging, and possibly a more sophisticated way of interpreting the LLM's responses.
